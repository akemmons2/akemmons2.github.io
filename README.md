## Python PDF Project

The details for this project can be found here: [Python PDF Project](https://github.com/AKEMMONS2/PythonProject_PDFExtraction.git).

The project consists of reading and exracting data from both text and image PDFs, assigning unique IDs to them, then sorting the data and exporting it into csv. The final piece of the project will be to create an app that can be accessed on my portfolio page demonstrating how others can access the app, upload a PDF and retrieve the data. Since there are many types and uses for PDFs, this project will begin by just focusing on extracting data from invoices and bills. 

## SQL Data Warehouse and Ebay API Integration.

Future project - this project will consist of building a SQL data warehouse in SQL Server Management Studio and using an API to push listings to EBAY and retrieve order details.
